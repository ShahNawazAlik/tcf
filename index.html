<h1>Rahabar Programme</h1>
<p>
        The Rahbar Programme was initiated in 2008 for eighth and ninth grade students of TCF. It is aimed at mentoring the youth to become responsible and productive members of the society.

The programme runs for seven consecutive Saturdays, three times a year at selected TCF Schools across Pakistan. The key feature of this programme is the ‘Thought to Destiny’ outlook which serves as the guiding principle to inspire young minds to think of themselves as creators of their own destiny rather than victims of their bleak circumstances.

<h1>A curriculum suited
for student success</h1>
<p>
       TCF school curriculum promotes an interactive, child centered teaching approach with emphasis on hands-on activities that help children learn, question and enjoy the learning process.

TCF’s academics team has referenced local and international educational guidelines to design the most appropriate curriculum, integrating best practices from across the world. Our curriculum is a rich blend of concepts identified in the National Curriculum and themes emphasized in other international curricula as well.
